Grammar for the Lox Programming Language

This file uses the grammar syntax described in the Crafting Interpreters book.

A rule is declared with a name, followed by ->, then by the sequence of characters produced by the rule,
then by a terminating ;. The rule's characters may refer to other rules, including itself, or 
a token in the Lox language.

A rule may map to one of several sequences. The rule can be re-defined for each sequence, or 
sequences can be separated with |.

Elements of a sequence can be grouped between ( and ).

Append a * to a symbol or group to indicate it may be repeated 0 or more times.

Append a + to a symbol or group to indicate it may be repeated 1 or more times.

Append a ? to a symbol or group to indicate it may appear 0 or 1 times.

For example, here is the 'breakfast' grammar used in the book:

breakfast -> protein ( "with" breakfast "on the side" )?
          | bread ;

protein   -> "really"+ "crispy" "bacon"
          | "sausage"
          | ( "scrambled" | "poached" | "fried" ) "eggs" ;

bread     -> "toast" | "biscuits" | "English muffin" ;
